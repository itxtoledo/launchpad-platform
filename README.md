# Tokenization Platform

Welcome to the **Tokenization Platform**! 🚀 This is an open-source project designed to provide a comprehensive solution for tokenizing assets on the blockchain. Our platform enables you to create, manage, and trade tokenized assets securely and efficiently. 

## How It Works 🛠️

This project is structured as a monorepo, managed with `pnpm` and `turbo`. It consists of two main parts:

-   **`apps/app`**: This is the frontend application, built with React and Vite. It provides the user interface for interacting with the tokenization platform, including creating, managing, and trading tokenized assets. It uses `wagmi` for blockchain interaction.
-   **`packages/contracts`**: This package contains the Solidity smart contracts for the tokenization platform, developed using Hardhat. These contracts define the core logic for asset tokenization, secure transactions, and automated agreements.

## Running 🚀

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the project root and install all dependencies using `pnpm`:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Smart Contracts Setup**:
    Navigate to the `packages/contracts` directory:
    ```bash
    cd packages/contracts
    ```
    Compile the smart contracts:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
    Run tests for the smart contracts (optional, but recommended):
    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```
    Deploy the smart contracts to a local development network (e.g., Hardhat Network):
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost # Assuming a deploy script exists, common in Hardhat projects
    ```
    *Note: You might need to start a local Hardhat network first in a separate terminal: `npx hardhat node`*

3.  **Frontend Application Setup**:
    Navigate back to the project root and then into the `apps/app` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../../apps/app
    ```
    Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application should now be accessible in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173` (as indicated by `vite.config.ts` in a Vite project).
