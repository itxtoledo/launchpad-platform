            Welcome to Launchpad Platform, a website-hosted user interface (the
            &quot;Interface&quot; or &quot;App&quot;) provided by Launchpad Platform (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;,
            or &quot;us&quot;). The Interface provides access to a decentralized protocol
            on various public blockchains that allows users to create, manage,
            and trade tokenized assets (&quot;the Launchpad Platform protocol&quot; or the
            &quot;Protocol&quot;). The Interface is one, but not the exclusive, means of
            accessing the Protocol. To use the Interface, you must use
            non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with
            public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet
            provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that
            third party, not this Terms of Service Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;).
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            This Agreement explains the terms and conditions by which you may
            access and use the Interface. You must read this Agreement
            carefully. By accessing or using the Interface, you signify that you
            have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in
            its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access
            or use the Interface and should not use the Interface.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 font-bold text-red-600">
            NOTICE: Please read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use
            of the Interface. This Agreement contains important information,
            including a binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver,
            both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved.
            The Interface is only available to you — and you should only access
            the Interface — if you agree completely with these terms.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">
            1. Modification of this Agreement
          </h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this
            Agreement from time to time. If we make any modifications, we will
            notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by
            maintaining a current version of the Agreement at Launchpad
            Platform&apos;s terms of services. All modifications will be effective
            when they are posted, and your continued accessing or use of the
            Interface will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those
            modifications. If you do not agree with any modifications to this
            Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using the
            Interface.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">2. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            To access or use the Interface, you must be able to form a legally
            binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at
            least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old
            in the United States) and have the full right, power, and authority
            to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this
            Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for
            which you may access or use the Interface.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic
            or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental
            authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or
            restricted parties (including but not limited to the list maintained
            by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of
            the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a
            jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive
            country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the
            United States. Finally, you represent that your access and use of
            the Interface will fully comply with all applicable laws and
            regulations, and that you will not access or use the Interface to
            conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">3. Proprietary Rights</h2>
          <p>
            We own all intellectual property and other rights in the Interface
            and its contents, including (but not limited to) software, text,
            images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and designs.
            This intellectual property is available under the terms of our
            copyright licenses and our Trademark Guidelines.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">4. Additional Rights</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the following rights, which do not constitute obligations
            of ours: (a) with or without notice to you, to modify, substitute,
            eliminate or add to the Interface; (b) to review, modify, filter,
            disable, delete and remove any and all content and information from
            the Interface; and (c) to cooperate with any law enforcement, court
            or government investigation or order or third party requesting or
            directing that we disclose information or content or information
            that you provide.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">5. Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            When you use the Interface, the only information we collect from you
            is your blockchain wallet address, completed transaction hashes, and
            the token names, symbols. We do not collect any personal information
            from you (e.g., your name or other identifiers that can be linked to
            you). We do, however, use third-party service providers which may
            receive or independently obtain your personal information from
            publicly-available sources. We do not control how these third
            parties handle your data and you should review their privacy
            policies to understand how they collect, use, and share your
            personal information. By accessing and using the Interface, you
            understand and consent to our data practices and our service
            providers&apos; treatment of your information.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            We use the information we collect to detect, prevent, and mitigate
            financial crime and other illicit or harmful activities on the
            Interface. For these purposes, we may share the information we
            collect with blockchain analytics providers. We share information
            with these service providers only so that they can help us promote
            the safety, security, and integrity of the Interface.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            Please note that when you use the Interface, you are interacting
            with Ethereum or another public blockchain, which by nature may
            provide transparency into your transactions. Launchpad Platform does
            not control and is not responsible for any information you make
            public on blockchains by taking actions through the Interface.
          </p>

          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">
            7. Not Registered with the SEC or Any Other Agency
          </h2>
          <p>
            We are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission as a national securities exchange or in any other
            capacity.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">
            8. Non-Solicitation; No Investment Advice
          </h2>
          <p>
            You agree and understand that: (a) all trades you submit through the
            Interface are considered unsolicited, which means that they are
            solely initiated by you; (b) you have not received any investment
            advice from us in connection with any trades.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">
            9. Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning you are
            solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys
            to the digital asset wallets you hold. This Agreement is not
            intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on
            us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and
            agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any
            other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities
            may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are
            hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further
            agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those
            set out expressly in this Agreement.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">
            10. Compliance and Tax Obligations
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Interface may not be available or appropriate for use in your
            jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Interface, you agree that
            you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws
            and regulations that may apply to you. Specifically, your use of the
            Interface or the Protocol may result in various tax consequences,
            such as income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and
            services tax, or sales tax in certain jurisdictions. It is your
            responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions
            you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the
            correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">11. Assumption of Risk</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are
            financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the
            inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and
            blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of
            the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as ether (ETH),
            so-called stablecoins, and other digital tokens such as those
            following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20).
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            In particular, you understand that the markets for these digital
            assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including
            (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security,
            and regulation. You understand that anyone can create a token,
            including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely
            claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk
            that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. So-called
            stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be
            fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and
            runs.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            Further, you understand that smart contract transactions
            automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based
            transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and
            accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and
            blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may
            increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and
            accept the risk of selecting to trade in Expert Modes, which can
            expose you to potentially significant price slippage and higher
            costs.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of
            these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and
            cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience
            while accessing or using the Interface. Accordingly, you understand
            and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of
            accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Protocol.
